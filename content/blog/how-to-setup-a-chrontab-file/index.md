How to set up a cron job in the terminal has seemed overwhelming for quite some time.  But after familiarizing myself with Vi the job seemed simpler to approach.  Here is a quick tutorial on navigating Vi and setting up a simple cron job.

#### Setting up a cron job ‚è∞
------------------------------------------------
- open your terminal
- navigate to home using `cd~/` or `cd`
- this is `Users/Amy` for me
- type `crontab -e`
note: to check and see if you have a crontab file type `crontab -l`, navigate to that crontab file if you do, if you do not continue from step four
- [Vi](https://docs.cs.cf.ac.uk/notes/the-vi-editor/) is the default text editor for cron, if your unfamiliar with the [vi](http://commandlinemac.blogspot.com/2008/12/vim.html) editor use the simple commands below or 
- type or paste the crontab file 
- press `esc` then type `:wq` to save and exit


- use the [Crontab Generator](https://crontab-generator.org/)

Vi operates by shifting to different `modes`, for example:
- to begin **writing text** after opening the file hit `esc` and then `i`.
- to begin **deleting text** type `x`, then press the `delete` key
- to **save and exit** press `esc` then :wq
- to **exit without saving** press `esc` then :q!
 For each task you must shift to the correct mode before doing so.

| dw |                                      deletes word after cursor|
