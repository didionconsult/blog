So I have been wanting to set up a Gatsby blog for a while now but was a bit intimidated.
I spent time looking at all of the examples out there which were inspiring and numerous.

I installed Gatsby.
Then I began taking notes.
But the best part was that I found [@k88hudson’s](@k88hudson’s ) [Prism Theme Generator](http://k88hudson.github.io/syntax-highlighting-theme-generator/www/) to generate a custom css template for prism.js.


I'm sure I'll write a lot more interesting things in the future.

Here is a quote from Wikipedia on how tulips were a speculative source of mania.
[Tulip Mania](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tulip_mania).

> At the peak of tulip mania, in February 1637, some single tulip bulbs sold for more than 10  times the annual income of a skilled artisan. Research is difficult because of the limited   economic data from the 1630s, much of which come from biased and speculative sources.

```js
const tulipMania = "dutch mania for Tulips"
