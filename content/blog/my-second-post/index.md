I have put together a short table of NPM commands to use as a quick reference guide.  These are the commands I found I used most often, perhaps forgot most often. I am a newish programmer so I have excluded more advanced commands. Send 📝 me any you feel are missing! 😊

### NPM Scripts
    note: a script must be set up in your package json to run these commands
