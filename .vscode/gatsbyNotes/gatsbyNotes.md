### Gatsby Notes

## What is gatsby-remark-prismjs
- takes content in your md files surrounded by ``` backtacks and auto formats it via the settings you have installed for Prism.js

## What is gatsby-transformer-remark
- a parser for the md files in our content folder. it parses markdown into html for rendering. 

## What is gatsby-source-filesystem
-  the plugin creates File nodes from the files in our system.

## SSG
- Gatsby is a Static Site Generator
- static site generator is a software application that creates HTML pages from templates or components and a given content source
- Most static site generators accept Markdown-formatted text files as a source.
- alternative to database driven cms's like wordpress, drupal; content stored in DB; server receives req; software retrieves data from DB, merges w/ template file; generates html page 
- SSG's reduce latency from using DB
- create react app, 11ty, next.js, jekyll are SSG's (11ty & Jekyll don't need React)

## monorepo
- gatsby uses monorepo for its code

## slug
- A Slug is the unique identifying part of a web address, typically at the end of the URL.
- the key: value pair set up in the header of the markdown file creates the url slug for that page

## frontmatter
the text in md b/w the two dashed lines in the header of your md file. used to populate the metadata for the site

## dangerouslySetInnerHTML
- Reactâ€™s replacement for using innerHTML in the browser DOM
- dangerous bc exposes site to XSS attack
